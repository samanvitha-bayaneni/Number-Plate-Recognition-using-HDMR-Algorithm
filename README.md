- License plate recognition involves three stages: image capture, preprocessing, and number recognition.
  
- HD MR Algorithm improves recognition of rotating digits on electric meters based on frame differentiation and recognition threshold.

- The algorithm reduces recognition time and ensures correct readings by comparing current and previous values.
